# PHP client documentation

This documentation is for PHP developers interested in using GOV.UK Notify to send emails, text messages or letters.

# Set up the client

Refer to the [client change log](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-php-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the client version number and the latest updates.

## Install the client

The Notify PHP Client can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run this command:

```
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter alphagov/notifications-php-client
```

### PSR-7 HTTP

The Notify PHP Client is based on a PSR-7 HTTP model. You therefore need to pick your preferred HTTP Client library to use.

We will show examples here using the Guzzle v6 Adapter.

_QP: What is this? Are we referring to all example code?_

Setup instructions are also available for [Curl](docs/curl-client-setup.md) and [Guzzle v5](docs/guzzle5-client-setup.md).

## Create a new instance of the client

Assuming youâ€™ve installed the package via Composer, the Notify PHP Client will be available via the autoloader.

Create a (Guzzle v6 based) instance of the Client using:

```php
$notifyClient = new \Alphagov\Notifications\Client([
    'apiKey' => '{your api key}',
    'httpClient' => new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client
]);
```

To get an API key, [log in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) and go to the __API integration__ page. You can find more information in the [API keys](/#api-keys) section.

# Send a message

GOV.UK Notify enables you to send text messages, emails and letters.

## Send a text message

### Method

```csharp
SmsNotificationResponse response = client.SendSms(mobileNumber, templateId, personalisation, reference, smsSenderId);
```


The method signature is:
```
sendSms( $phoneNumber, $templateId, array $personalisation = array(), $reference = '', $smsSenderId = NULL  )
```

An example request would look like:

```
try {

    $response = $notifyClient->sendSms(
        '+447777111222',
        'df10a23e-2c6d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93a', [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968'
        ],
        'unique_ref123',
        '862bfaaf-9f89-43dd-aafa-2868ce2926a9'
    );

} catch (NotifyException $e){}
```

_QP: How does method relate to request?_

### Arguments

#### $phoneNumber (required)

The phone number of the recipient of the text message. This number can be UK or international.

#### $templateId (required)

The ID of the template. You can find this by logging into [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) and going to the __Templates__ page.

#### $personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you need to __provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs__. For example:

```
personalisation = [
    'name' => 'Betty Smith',
    'dob'  => '12 July 1968'
]
```

#### $reference (optional)

A unique identifier. This reference can identify a single unique notification or a batch of multiple notifications.

_Example?_

#### smsSenderId (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification. To set this up:

1. Log into your GOV.UK Notify account.
1. Go to __Settings__.
1. Check that you are in the correct service. If you are not, select __Switch service__ in the top right corner of the screen and select the correct one.
1. Go to the __Text Messages__ section and select __Manage__ on the "Text Message sender" row.
1. You can do one of the following:
  - copy the ID of the sender you want to use and paste it into the method
  - select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service will use, and select __Save__

_example?_

If you omit this argument from your method, the client will set the default `smsSenderId` for the notification.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive the following `SmsNotificationResponse` response:

```
[
    "id" => "bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
    "reference" => None,
    "content" => [
        "body" => "Some words",
        "from_number" => "40604"
    ],
    "uri" => "https =>//api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/notifications/ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cd",
    "template" => [
        "id" => "ceb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda",
       "version" => 1,
       "uri" => "https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk/v2/templates/bfb50d92-100d-4b8b-b559-14fa3b091cda"
    ]
]
```

If you are using the [test API key](/#test), all your messages will come back as delivered.

All successfully delivered messages will appear on your dashboard.

### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client will raise an `HTTPError`:

## Send a letter

When your service first signs up to GOV.UK Notify, youâ€™ll start in trial mode. You can only send letters in live mode.

### Method

The method signature is:

```
sendLetter( $templateId, array $personalisation = array(), $reference = '' )
```

An example request would look like:

```
try {

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name'=>'Fred',
            'address_line_1' => 'Foo',
            'address_line_2' => 'Bar',
            'postcode' => 'Baz'
        ],
        'unique_ref123'
    );

} catch (NotifyException $e){}
```

### Arguments

#### $templateId (required)

The ID of the template. You can find this by logging into GOV.UK Notify and going to the __Templates__ page.

#### $personalisation (required)

The personalisation argument always contains the following required parameters for the letter recipient's address:

- `address_line_1`
- `address_line_2`
- `postcode`

```
personalisation = [
    'name' => 'Betty Smith',
    'dob'  => '12 July 1968'
]
```

_QP: Is this correct? I took this from the PHP docs_


Any other placeholder fields included in the letter template also count as required parameters. You need to provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

_QP: How do you provide the information?_

_example?_

#### "yourReferenceString" (optional)

A unique identifier. This reference can identify a single unique notification or a batch of multiple notifications.

```python
reference=â€™STRINGâ€™ # optional string - identifies notification(s)
```

#### personalisation (optional)

The following parameters in the letter recipient's address are optional:

```csharp
Dictionary<String, dynamic> personalisation = new Dictionary<String, dynamic>
{
{ "address_line_1", "23 Foo Road" }, # required
{ "address_line_2", "Bar Town" }, # required
{ "address_line_3", "London" },
{ "postcode", "BAX S1P" } # required
... # any other optional address lines, or personalisation fields found in your template
};
```
Otherwise the parameter can be omitted or `null` can be passed in its place.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive the following `LetterNotificationResponse` response:

```

{
    { "name", "someone" }
};
```

# Get received text messages

This API call returns received text messages. Depending on which method you use, you can either get all received text messages, or a page of up to 250 text messages.

## Get all received text messages

This method will return a `ReceivedTextMessageList` with all received text messages.

### Method

```
    $this->listReceivedTexts(
      $older_than  // optional
    );
```

### Arguments

#### olderThanId (optional)

Input the ID of a received text message into this argument. If you use this argument, the next 250 received text messages older than the given ID are returned.

_EXAMPLE_

If this argument is omitted, the most recent 250 text messages are returned.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive a `ReceivedTextMessageList` response that will return all received texts.

```
[
    "received_text_messages" => [
        [
            "id" => "notify_id",
            "user_number" => "user number",
            "notify_number" => "notify number",
            "created_at" => "created at",
            "service_id" => "service id",
            "content" => "text content"
        ],
        [
            ... another received text message
        ]
    ]
  ],
  "links" => [
     "current" => "/received-text-messages",
     "next" => "/received-text-messages?older_than=last_id_in_list"
  ]
]
```

A `ReceivedText` will have the following properties -

```csharp
public String id;
public String userNumber;
public String createdAt;
public String serviceId;
public String notifyNumber;
public String content;

```

## Get one page of received text messages

_DOES THIS APPLY?_

This will return one page of up to 250 text messages.  

### Method

```python
response = client.get_received_texts(older_than)
```

You can specify which texts to receive by inputting the ID of a received text message into the [`older_than`](/#get-one-page-of-received-text-messages-optional-arguments-older-than) argument.

### Arguments

#### olderThanId (optional)

Input the ID of a received text message into this argument. If you use this argument, the next 250 received text messages older than the given ID are returned.

```python
older_than=â€™740e5834-3a29-46b4-9a6f-16142fde533aâ€™ # optional string - notification ID
```

If this argument is omitted, the most recent 250 text messages are returned.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, you will receive a `dict` response.


```python
{
  "received_text_messages":
  [
    {
      "id": "STRING", # required string - ID of received text message
      "user_number": "STRING", # required string
      "notify_number": "STRING", # required string - receiving number
      "created_at": "STRING", # required string - date and time template created
      "service_id": "STRING", # required string - service ID
      "content": "STRING" # required string - text content
    },
    â€¦
  ],
  "links": {
    "current": "/received-text-messages",
    "next": "/received-text-messages?other_than=last_id_in_list"
  }
}
```
